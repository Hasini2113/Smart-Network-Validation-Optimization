# Smart Computer Program for Network Validation & Optimization

This project was developed as part of the **Cisco Virtual Internship – Networking Stream (2025)**.  
It automates **network validation, optimization, and simulation** using configuration parsing, topology generation, and Packet Tracer.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Networking_Solution_Final_Report_1` → Full project report with implementation, results, and discussion.
- `cisco.pkt` → Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the final implemented network topology.
- `README.md` → Documentation and usage instructions.
- `network_report`->Contains the network toplogy,validation results.load analysis,suggestions table

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Network Topology Generation**: Parses config files and builds topology.
- **Validation Engine**: Detects duplicate IPs, VLAN mismatches, MTU mismatches, and loops.
- **Load Analyzer**: Identifies overloaded links and suggests alternate paths.
- **Simulation & Fault Injection**: Validates resilience using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## 🖥️ Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **Python** (NetworkX, Matplotlib, ReportLab)
- **Google Colab**

---

## 📊 Results
- ✅ No duplicate IPs, VLAN, or MTU mismatches  
- ⚠ Loops detected (`R2-S1-S2`, `R2-R1-S1`)  
- ⚠ Link `R3-S2` overloaded by 4 Mbps  
- ✅ Alternate path suggested: `S1 → S2 → R2` (58 Mbps available)  

---

## 📥 How to Use
1. Download and open `Topology.pkt` in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. View results and CLI screenshots in `Final_Report.pdf`.
3. Extend by adding your own configuration files for testing.

---

## 📌 Future Scope
- Real-time monitoring integration (SNMP/NetFlow).
- AI/ML-based predictive analysis.
- Automated remediation scripts.
